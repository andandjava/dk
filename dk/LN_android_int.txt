life cycle methods of an activity
can we append data from asynchTask to UI directly
can we stop onResume method not to execute.
if app goes to pause state/onDestroy state then how can we get the data
why we are using volatile memory(it can be done using GC also)
Have you published any app?how can we publish an app?
which building tool supports Eclipse? Does gradle supports Eclipse?
what is gradle?
You opened many apps which are not closed/terminated(opened).if the stack is full then what happens?



after asyncTask we get a command from server...such that u have to execute that particular UI and resend the data to server
